# Metadata about variables

The Fragile Families Challenge datafile does not include all the metadata that participants might want to use.  We will post participant contributed metadata information in here.

ffc_variable_types.csv describes variables types (categorical, continuous, unknown) for each variable.  It was created by [Connor Gilroy](https://github.com/ccgilroy) as described in this [blog post](http://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/metadata-about-variables/).
